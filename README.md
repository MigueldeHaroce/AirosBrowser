# Wellcome to AirosBrowser!

Airos is an open-source web browser that offers a private and secure browsing experience, incorporating the powerful GPT-3 language model from OpenAI. The browser is built on Electron, a framework that utilizes web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, making AirosBrowser compatible with all platforms.

One of the key features of AirosBrowser is its integration with GPT-3, allowing users to ask questions and receive instant answers. By clicking the "Magic Button" on the search bar, users can type their questions and AirosBrowser sends them to the GPT-3 API, which processes the query and returns a natural language response. This functionality is especially useful for researching, learning, or simply exploring.

AirosBrowser also focuses on privacy. The browser does not store cookies, ensuring that your browsing history and personal data are not collected or shared with third parties. Your online activity remains private and secure.

Additionally, AirosBrowser introduces a new functionality, an integrated keychain to securely store your passwords. Through encryption on the blockchain, hacking becomes practically impossible. This keychain allows you to easily manage and access your different online accounts without the need to remember multiple passwords. Your login credentials are securely stored, improving security by avoiding the use of weak or repeated passwords.

In summary, AirosBrowser is a unique web browser that focuses on privacy and incorporates the GPT-3 model to enhance your browsing experience. It is an open-source project, compatible with all platforms.
